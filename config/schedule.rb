# It's helpful, but not entirely necessary to understand cron before proceeding.

# Example:
#

#remember to create this log: /home/app/applications/scenario/current/log/whenever.log

# set :output, "/home/gary/idapted/zhangzhe/log/whenever.log"
# every 1.minutes do
#   runner "puts ('ye')"
#   command "date"
# end
